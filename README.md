# esp8266-fan-control

ESP8266-based PWM fan control with a BME280 temperature sensor.

## Hardware

The following hardware is used:
* [Adafruit Feather HUZZAH with ESP8266](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2821)
* [Noctua NF-A12x25 5V PWM](https://noctua.at/en/nf-a12x25-5v-pwm)
* BME280 Sensor
* 2K Ohm resistor (anything above 1K Ohm should work) 

## Setup

This software uses Adafruit's ESP8266 Feather board with the Arduino IDE as described [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-huzzah-esp8266/using-arduino-ide).
